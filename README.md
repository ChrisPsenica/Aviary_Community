This is a supplemental repository where the Aviary community, students and professors, and enthusiasts, can share aircraft models, rubber engines, a mission models. This was created as a supplement of the Aviary repo. The official Aviary repo only includes aircraft used for testing and didactic examples and there was a need for a place for people to share other models. 
 
The examples in this repo are typically the work of students and no guarantees are given to the accuracy or quality of these models. You are welcome to share and use any of these example aircraft. When uploading a model we encourage you to cite your sources for where you got your data so that other users can trace your footsteps.
